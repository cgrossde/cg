# ChatGPT CLI client

- Easily invoke ChatGPT from the CLI
- Keeps a session, so you can have a "conversation"
- Let it suggest shell commands(`-s`) as well as explain(`-e`) or run(`-x`) them
- You can pipe data to it  e.g. `cat some.json | cg -s Write a jq command to extract all objects with tag "foo" for the following example JSON:`
- Give it a bias or let it assume one of the shipped personas (`-b`)

```
